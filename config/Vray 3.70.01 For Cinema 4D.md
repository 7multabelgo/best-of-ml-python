## What is Vray 3.70.01 for Cinema 4D?
 
Vray 3.70.01 for Cinema 4D is a rendering plugin that works with Cinema 4D R18, R19, R20, and R21. It is based on the V-Ray Next technology, which is the most advanced and optimized version of V-Ray to date.
 
Vray 3.70.01 for Cinema 4D allows you to render photorealistic images and animations with realistic lighting, materials, and effects. You can also use it to create stylized and artistic renders with various tools and modes.
 
Some of the key features of Vray 3.70.01 for Cinema 4D are:
 
- **Adaptive Dome Light:** This feature automatically optimizes the lighting of your scene and eliminates the need for setting up skylight portals or manually tweaking light parameters. It also supports image-based lighting (IBL) and can render faster and cleaner than the standard dome light.
- **GPU+CPU Hybrid Rendering:** This feature enables you to use both your CPU and GPU resources to speed up your rendering process. You can also choose to render only with your CPU or GPU depending on your preference and hardware configuration.
- **AI Denoiser:** This feature uses artificial intelligence to remove noise from your renders in a matter of seconds. You can use it during interactive rendering or as a post-process effect.
- **V-Ray Toon Shader:** This feature allows you to create non-photorealistic renders with a cartoon-like appearance. You can control the amount of detail, outline width, contour color, and shading style of your objects.
- **V-Ray Volume Grid:** This feature lets you import and render volumetric data from simulations such as smoke, fire, and fog. You can also use it to create procedural volumetric effects with noise and texture maps.
- **V-Ray Proxy:** This feature enables you to render massive scenes with millions of polygons without slowing down your viewport or running out of memory. You can use it to load and render high-resolution meshes, point clouds, or Alembic files.
