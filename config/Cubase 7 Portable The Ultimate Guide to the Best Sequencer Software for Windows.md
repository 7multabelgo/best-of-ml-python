Cubase 7 Portable is ideal for musicians, producers, and engineers who need a portable and flexible solution for creating music on different computers. Cubase 7 Portable can be used on any Windows 7, 8, or 10 computer that meets the minimum system requirements and has a USB port or an external hard drive connection. Cubase 7 Portable can also be used on Mac OS X computers with the help of an ISO image file and a virtual drive software. Cubase 7 Portable does not require activation or registration, but it does require a USB-eLicenser dongle with a valid Cubase 7 license to run.
 
Cubase 7 Portable offers the same functionality and performance as the installed version of Cubase 7, with some minor limitations. For example, Cubase 7 Portable cannot access the Windows registry or the user preferences folder, so some settings may need to be adjusted manually each time it is launched. Cubase 7 Portable also cannot use ASIO drivers that are installed on the host computer, so it may require a compatible audio interface with its own drivers to ensure low latency and high quality audio playback and recording. Cubase 7 Portable may also take longer to load and save projects than the installed version of Cubase 7.

## MixConsole: A New Mixer Experience
 
One of the most noticeable changes in Cubase 7 is the redesigned mixer, called MixConsole, which replaces the old Mixer window. MixConsole is a modern and sleek interface that aims to provide a more intuitive and flexible mixing workflow. MixConsole can be resized, zoomed, and scrolled horizontally and vertically to fit any screen size and resolution. It also supports multiple displays and full-screen mode.
 
MixConsole offers several new features and enhancements that make mixing easier and more efficient. For example, you can now create custom channel configurations and recall them instantly with the new Channel Zones and Visibility features. You can also use the new Channel Strip section to access EQ, dynamics, saturation, and other effects for each channel. MixConsole also integrates seamlessly with the new Remote Control Editor, which lets you assign parameters to external controllers with a simple drag-and-drop interface.
 
Another new feature in MixConsole is the Control Room, which is a dedicated section for setting up cue mixes, monitor mixes, talkback, and metronome. The Control Room allows you to create up to four independent cue mixes for different performers, as well as switch between different monitor setups and sources. You can also use the Control Room to insert plug-ins on the master output or on individual cue sends.

## Chord Track: A Harmonic Helper
 
Cubase 7 introduces a new Chord Track, which is a global track that can store chord events and analyze the harmonic structure of your project. The Chord Track can help you create chord progressions, harmonize melodies, transpose songs, and more. You can enter chords manually or use the new Chord Assistant to generate suggestions based on various criteria. You can also use the new Chord Pads to trigger chords in real time with your keyboard or mouse.
 
The Chord Track can also interact with other tracks in your project and influence their playback according to the chord events. For example, you can use the new VariAudio 2.0 feature to edit monophonic audio tracks in pitch and time and make them follow the chords automatically. You can also use the new Chord Track Inspector to adjust the voicing and tension of each chord event.
 
The Chord Track is a powerful tool for composers, songwriters, and producers who want to explore harmonic possibilities and create musical variations. Cubase 7 also includes a new Chord Library with hundreds of presets for different genres and styles. You can also create your own chord presets and share them with other users.
