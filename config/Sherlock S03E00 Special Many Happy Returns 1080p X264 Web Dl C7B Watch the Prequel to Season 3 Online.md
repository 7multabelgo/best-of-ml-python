If you are a fan of the BBC series Sherlock, you might have been eagerly waiting for the third season to premiere. But before you watch the first episode, you might want to check out a mini-episode that was released online as a prequel. The mini-episode, titled "Many Happy Returns", is a seven-minute clip that shows what happened after Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) faked his death at the end of season two.

The mini-episode features John Watson (Martin Freeman), DI Lestrade (Rupert Graves), Molly Hooper (Louise Brealey), and Anderson (Jonathan Aris), who are trying to move on with their lives after Sherlock's apparent demise. However, Anderson is not convinced that Sherlock is really dead, and he shows Lestrade some evidence that suggests that Sherlock might have survived and is still solving crimes around the world. Meanwhile, John receives a mysterious DVD from Sherlock on his birthday, with a message that hints at his return.
 
The mini-episode is a clever and intriguing teaser for the new season, as it raises some questions about how Sherlock managed to pull off his stunt and what he has been doing since then. It also gives us a glimpse of how the other characters are coping with his absence, and how they might react when they see him again. The mini-episode is full of references and Easter eggs for the fans, such as the newspaper headlines, the cases that Sherlock solves, and the song that plays at the end.
 
You can watch the mini-episode on YouTube[^4^] or on PBS[^6^]. It is also available on IMDb[^5^] with some trivia and user reviews. If you are looking for a short but satisfying dose of Sherlock before the new season begins, you should definitely watch "Many Happy Returns".
  
After watching the mini-episode, you might be wondering what to expect from the third season of Sherlock. Well, according to the creators and the cast, the new season will be darker, funnier, and more emotional than the previous ones. The season will consist of three episodes, each based on a different story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The titles of the episodes are "The Empty Hearse", "The Sign of Three", and "His Last Vow".
 
The first episode, "The Empty Hearse", will reveal how Sherlock survived his fall from the roof of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and how he reunites with John after two years. The episode is loosely based on "The Adventure of the Empty House", in which Sherlock returns from his apparent death at the hands of Professor Moriarty. The episode will also introduce a new villain, Charles Augustus Magnussen (Lars Mikkelsen), a powerful media tycoon and a master blackmailer.
 
The second episode, "The Sign of Three", will focus on John's wedding to Mary Morstan (Amanda Abbington), a former nurse and a new character in the series. The episode is inspired by "The Sign of the Four", in which Sherlock helps Mary find her missing father and his treasure. The episode will also feature Sherlock as John's best man, and his attempt to give a speech at the reception.
 
The third and final episode, "His Last Vow", will pit Sherlock against Magnussen, who has a hold over many influential people. The episode is based on "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", in which Sherlock breaks into the house of a notorious blackmailer and faces a moral dilemma. The episode will also explore Sherlock's relationship with his brother Mycroft (Mark Gatiss), and his parents (played by Benedict Cumberbatch's real parents).
