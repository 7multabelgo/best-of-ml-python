In the following paragraphs, we will briefly introduce each of the six women featured in Amores Malditos and their respective love stories.
 
## Cleopatra: The Queen of the Nile
 
Cleopatra was the last ruler of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt, a descendant of one of Alexander the Great's generals. She was renowned for her beauty, intelligence and charisma, as well as her political savvy and ambition. She had two famous lovers: Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, both powerful Roman generals and politicians. She bore children to both of them and tried to secure her throne and independence from Rome by allying with them. However, her plans were thwarted by Octavian, Caesar's heir and Antony's rival, who defeated them in a series of battles and eventually drove them to suicide. Cleopatra chose to end her life by letting a venomous snake bite her, rather than being captured and paraded as a trophy by Octavian.
 
## Anne Boleyn: The Second Wife of Henry VIII
 
Anne Boleyn was a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of Henry VIII, the king of England. She caught the king's eye and refused to become his mistress, insisting on marriage instead. Henry was so enamored with her that he broke with the Catholic Church and established the Church of England in order to divorce Catherine and marry Anne. Anne gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, who would later become one of England's greatest monarchs, but failed to produce a male heir. Henry grew tired of her and accused her of adultery, incest and treason. She was executed by beheading at the Tower of London in 1536.
 
## Marie Antoinette: The Last Queen of France
 
Marie Antoinette was the daughter of Maria Theresa, the empress of Austria, and was married to Louis XVI, the king of France, when she was only 14 years old. She was a fashionable and frivolous young woman who enjoyed lavish parties, gambling and spending money on clothes and jewels. She was also unpopular among the French people, who resented her foreign origin, extravagance and perceived indifference to their plight. She became a symbol of the corruption and decadence of the monarchy during the French Revolution. She and her husband were imprisoned, tried and guillotined in 1793.
