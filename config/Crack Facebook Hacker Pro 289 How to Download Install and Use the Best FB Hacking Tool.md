# Synopsys Design Compiler: A Comprehensive RTL Synthesis Solution
 
Synopsys Design Compiler is a family of products that provides a complete solution for RTL synthesis, optimization, and verification. Design Compiler enables users to meet today's design challenges with concurrent optimization of timing, area, power and test. Design Compiler includes innovative topographical technology that enables a predictable flow resulting in faster time to results. Topographical technology provides timing and area prediction within 10% of the results seen post-layout enabling designers to reduce costly iterations between synthesis and physical implementation. Design Compiler also includes a scalable infrastructure that delivers 2X faster runtime on quad-core platforms.

Design Compiler is the core of Synopsys' comprehensive RTL synthesis solution, including Power Compilerâ¢, DesignWareÂ®, PrimeTimeÂ®, and DFTMAXâ¢. Design Compiler NXT is also available and includes best-in-class quality-of-results, congestion prediction and alleviation capabilities, physical viewer, and floorplan exploration. Additionally Design Compiler NXT produces physical guidance to IC Compiler, place-and-route solution for tighter correlation to layout and faster placement runtime.
 
Design Compiler supports a wide range of design styles and technologies, from custom digital to mixed-signal IC design. It integrates with Synopsys Custom Compilerâ¢ design environment, a modern solution for full-custom analog, custom digital, and mixed-signal IC design. Custom Compiler provides design entry, simulation management and analysis, and custom layout editing features. It delivers industry-leading productivity, performance, and ease-of-use while remaining easy to adopt for users of legacy tools.
 
Design Compiler offers more flexibility for users to control optimization on specific areas of designs. It enables higher efficiency with integrated static timing analysis, test synthesis and power synthesis. It supports multi-voltage and multi-supply designs. It also offers cross-probing between RTL, schematic, and timing reports for fast debug.
