Zamfir was born on April 6th, 1941 in GÄeÈti, a small town in Romania. He started playing the pan flute at the age of 14, after hearing it on the radio. He studied at the Bucharest Academy of Music, where he learned classical music and folk music from various regions of Romania. He also developed his own technique of playing the pan flute, which involved circular breathing, vibrato, and a wide range of expression.
 
In 1969, Zamfir met Marcel Cellier, a Swiss ethnomusicologist who was fascinated by his music. Cellier invited Zamfir to perform in Switzerland and recorded his first album, Flute de Pan et Orgue. The album was a success and introduced Zamfir to a wider audience in Europe. Zamfir continued to record and tour with Cellier, who also produced his albums and promoted his music.
 
In 1975, Zamfir collaborated with James Last, a German composer and bandleader who was popular for his easy listening and pop music. They recorded an album called Classics by Moonlight, which featured Zamfir's pan flute playing over Last's orchestral arrangements of classical melodies. The album was a hit and spawned several more albums and concerts with Last. One of their most famous songs was The Lonely Shepherd, which was used as the theme song for the 1976 film The Message.
 
Zamfir also became known for his film music, especially for his haunting pan flute melodies that added a touch of mystery and exoticism to the movies. He composed or performed music for films such as Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), Karate Kid Part II (1986), Once Upon a Time in America (1984), and Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003). He also appeared in some films as himself or as a pan flute player.
